# nvdavim NVDA script for GVim, the GUI version of Vim on Windows

Place `vim.py` in your NVDA scripts scratchpad, restart nvda and  start gvim.
Scripts scratchpad is at: 
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\nvda\scratchpad\appModules`

Ensure that the setting in Advanced in NVDA allows for scratchpad scripts.
I'll improve the docs here soon.
